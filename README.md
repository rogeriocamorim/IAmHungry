# IAmHungry - Skip The Dishes - São Paulo VanHack Challenge

During the event for java develops, it was requested to develop an API that can do some functions such as:
- Allow Authentication;
- Query Products;
- Receive Orders;
- Cancel an Order;
- Get Order Status;
- Store data in a database of his/her choice;

## Getting Started

To develop the activities we received a website with what our API show looks like. (http://api-vanhack-event-sp.azurewebsites.net/swagger/). Based on that we had 11h to find the best approach for doing that in any technology that we think most fit and comfortable to do it.
So I starting mapping the entity and the relations between them. And after that, I started using Spring boot + Spring JPA + Spring Rest to fast development.
As the main language, I use Java 8, the database was mysql running locally on my computer, maven for library maintance and git to version all the changes during the development.

### Prerequisites

JDK 8

MYSQL Database

Maven

### Installing

1- Clone the repository
